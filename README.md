This project focuses on building and deploying a data science model using FastAPI. 
The goal is to perform analysis modeling on a dataset and serve the model through an API for easy access and integration.
The project is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use for anyone who wants to deploy their models using FastAPI.

Project Objectives: Perform data preprocessing and analysis, build a predictive model using suitable machine learning techniques
develop a FastAPI application to serve the model, test the API locally and ensure it works with different inputs, maintain clean and readable code for future improvements.

Key Components: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Training and Evaluation, API Development with FastAPI, Integration and Testing.

README.txt

Installation Steps: Clone the repository, create a virtual environment and activate it, install required libraries from requirements.txt,
run the FastAPI app using the command uvicorn app.main:app --reload, access the API at http://localhost:8000, use the interactive Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Usage: Send a POST request to the API endpoint with input data in JSON format. The API returns predictions based on the trained model.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas and NumPy, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Uvicorn.

Future Enhancements: Add authentication and authorization, enable model retraining via API, deploy to a cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS.
